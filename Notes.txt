BUGS

[ ] Increase falloff rate for sound sources (add configuration to pd-haskell)

[ ] Add touch-blobbing inside cubes

[ ] Haptic feedback for touching cubes

[ ] Add Icon http://stackoverflow.com/questions/708238/how-do-i-add-an-icon-to-a-mingw-gcc-compiled-executable

[ ] Remove Console
      Use:
      -optl-mwindows ??

[ ] Render to each eye simultaneously

[ ] Apply handOffset right at the point of putting the hands into the player struct rather than offsetting all over the codebase

[ ] Reduce physics server latency (only cache one frame?)

[x] Fix sound sources not staying stably attached to the cube they started from
    (we should round robin the oldest expiring source onto the newest cube)
[x] Fix shivering avatars 
      (is the server maybe relaying this back to us or something? 
      Or, did I fix this by removing the reliable flag from player positions?)
[x] Delete cube physics bodies
[x] Fix drift in Hydra
[x] Fix judder
[x] Fix freeze
[x] Fix size of collider/mesh mismatch
[?] Disconnecting players still leave zombie hands

FEATURES

[ ] Grabbing
[ ] FFT as texture
[ ] Add viscosity


[x] Add more lights to shaders
[x] Collision for hands
[x] Sound v1 
  [x] Sound v2
      ( https://soundcloud.com/chvrches/chvrches-leave-a-trace-four-tet-remix-1 )
[x] Set up proper uniforms for player hands, passing orientations etc. to control the shaders
[x] Pass parameters to the room

[x] Rendered remote heads should include oculus position
[x] Head shaders should look like deformable head

[x] Add view recentering to hydra start buttons
[x] Slow down the hydra joystick raising/lowering
[x] Fix cube firing timer (even though we're getting rid of that...)

[x] Simpler client/server setup for standalone executable;
    [x] Either have the server continually pulse out its IP and have the client listen for it
        (it should reset its state when it connects, besides the players current position which it can send)
    [x] Or have the client read from a textfile who it should connect to
    (we could do a UI with freetype-gl-mini too if we want.)
    Have server obtain its own IP.

[x] Update oculus-mini to Oculus SDK 0.6
[x] Try gl_Discard on fragments outside of SDF boundary



SIDEPROJECTS
[x] Get stack-ide-sublime working on Windows
[x] Finish Halive on Windows






DONE
[x] Fix bunk movement

[x] Hydra calibration

[x] Fire cube on trigger
  [x] Restrict rate

[x] Transmit player/hand positions
  [x] Add head pose field to Player and transmit to server
[x] Cube expiration
