Log of attempting to fix linking pd on windows:

First attempt, seeing if ghc's mingw\bin being in the path was wrong.
This had no effect...
Path was originally
C:\msys64\usr\local\ghc-7.10.1\mingw\bin;C:\msys64\usr\local\ghc-7.10.1\bin;C:\Users\lukex_000\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin;C:\Users\lukex_000\AppData\Roaming\local\bin;C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3;

Changing to:
C:\msys64\usr\local\ghc-7.10.1\bin;C:\Users\lukex_000\AppData\Roaming\cabal\bin;C:\Users\lukex_000\AppData\Roaming\local\bin;C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3;

in ~/.profile, it was
PATH=/usr/local/ghc-7.10.1/mingw/bin:/c/Users/lukex_000/AppData/Roaming/cabal/bin:$PATH

changing to
PATH=/c/Users/lukex_000/AppData/Roaming/cabal/bin:$PATH

DETERMINED ROOT CAUSE:
The problem occurs when cabal tries to compile a file that uses Template Haskell.
So e.g. testpdpack/Types.hs imports Control.Lens, defines a data type and derives lenses using the TH makeLenses function.
It doesn't matter if Types.hs doesn't import a library that needs a DLL, it fails anyway just if said library is listed in the .cabal file that defines the library Types is compiled into.

So, one crappy workaround would be to separate out a package just for types that need Template Haskell derivation.
Or, to manually add the Template Haskell splices. Neither are very fun, and the first one won't work for types
that depend on dll-needing-library types (e.g. data Entity = Entity {entityBody::RigidBody} for udpcubes/bullet-mini)

The problem does NOT occur with just calling ghc directly via cabal exec; e.g. cabal exec -- ghc Types.hs (Main works too).
(this is because GHC on its own doesn't try to link unneccessary libs during TH linking)

So that is another workaround; udpcubes can go back to building its executables monolithically rather than splitting out a library and using the "run" script as before.
(we only split out the libraries for stack usage)


I've built a debug version of ghc, which can be put into play for a cabal session with:
cabal run --with-ghc='C:/msys64/home/lukex_000/Code/ghc/inplace/bin/ghc-stage2.exe'
