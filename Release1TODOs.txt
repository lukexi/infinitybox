[ ] Collisions
  [x] Track collisions from Bullet and transmit them to clients for reaction
    [x] Better to do the filtering on the server, and change the event to be finer-grained
  [x] Pass collision intensity back from Bullet so we can ignore light touches
  [ ] Mask center-cube collision to be hand-only until it is first touched by a hand
  [x] Sound on collision, both with hands, walls, and other cubes
  [x] Visual on collision
    [x] Similar system to how we're doing beats? Just a decaying value refreshed on each hit.
[ ] Remote player hands light scene?

[ ] Storyboard
  [x] Center cube should start a timer to spawn the next cube when touched
  [ ] Stop spawning cubes after 16 (remove expiration system)
  [ ] Replace last cube with Tree on last hit
  [ ] Add wireframe cube to center of room

STORYBOARD:

Tree floating inside of wireframe cube, hands in front of it.
Either you touch it or after a moment the tree shrinks down, wireframe room scales up to surround you.
Room is initially Dark.
A bright infinitybox cube scales into existence.
You hit it, and it leaves behind a wireframe ghost. A new infinitybox scales into place to be hit.

Each cube increases the brightness of the room.

After you've hit out 16 cubes, some process begins that turns the cubes fragile, 
such that the next time you hit any of them they are destroyed.

Now, each time you hit one, the room darkens.

When you are down to one cube, the room is completely dark again and the cube turns back into
the original Tree which can then be hit endlessly around the room again.



Experience supports 2 players. In release version we aim to do matchmaking and put 2 people in same room for full duration of experience. Can do late join if nothing else available. Make sure ergonomics of room and avatars are good, i.e., play this experience together.
